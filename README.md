## WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO BUILD ?
We have built a professional social newtwork for job seekers and recruiters to connect with each other in a semi-formal way.

## FEATURES
* A user can signup and then login to use the platform. Post videos/photos and informational content.
* Users can follow each other to connect with each other.
* Create you profile and update it with your latest skills and projects to attract attention.
* Recruiter can post jobs. Likewise job seekers can apply for them.
* Search people in your area or specific companies to connect with them.
* See what is trending and what people are taking about.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
* Frontend : HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, Jquery.
* Backend : Expressjs, Nodejs, Mongodb, handlebars (templating engine)
* Packages and modules : Bcrypt, multer, mongoose, express-session, cloudinary(for hosting images).
* Deployment : Heroku, Mongodb Atlas.

## FUTURE SCOPE OF IMPROVEMENT
* As the emphasis was on building a working model of the project in limited time, the frontend part suffered. There is a lot of scope for improvement there.
* Posting and applying for jobs requires improvement.
* A resume can be generated in the basis of profile details.
* Sharing each otherâ€™s posts can be implemented.
* Messaging functionality.
